//      ДЗ 6. SIMPLE QUIZ

// You need to make simple quiz.

// Ask the users a few questions (>4), using prompt.
// If the answer is right add 10 points (for every right answers).
// If the answer is wrong or user clicked cancel - you don't add any points.
// When the user will answer all questions, show the result using alert (like: You have 30 points. You answered correctly for 3/10.).

// Some question for example:

// How much will 2+2?
// The sun rises in the east?
// How much will 5 / 0 be?
// What color is the sky?
// What is the correct answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and all that. (42)
